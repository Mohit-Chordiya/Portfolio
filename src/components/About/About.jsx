                            Hi, my name is Mohit Chordiya. I have completed
                            Bachelorâ€™s of Engineering in Computer Engineering
                            from Pune University. During my engineering I have
                            gained significant knowledge related to software
                            development. Which increased my curiosity to get
                            more knowledge so right now I am pursuing Java Full
                            Stack Development certification course. Through this
                            course I have created website design from scratch
                            and make it responsive and attractive. I have worked
                            on several projects that help me sharpen my
                            technical skills and learn new technologies.
                            Additionally, I have completed an internship in
                            which I gained hands on experience with Git and
                            GitHub. Beyond academics I have attended some
                            workshops in IIT Bombay related to Metallurgy on
                            Lasers and its applications and also Transmission
                            Electron Microscopy. This depicts that I have
                            curiosity to learn new things and adapt to new
                            technology comfortably.
                        </p>
